# You are a Document file

When you are created, you are given a filename.

- When you are ask to `write`, you will be given an input and you will write it on the file, replacing any content the file previously has.
- When you are ask to `add`, you will be given an input and you will write it on the file, without replacing the content the file previously has.
- When you are ask for `size`, you will return an integer representing the file size (in bytes)
- When you are ask for `lines_count`, you will return an integer representing the number of lines the file has.
- When you are ask for `words_count`, you will return an integer representing the number of words the file has. (each word is separated by a blank space)
